# Welcome to DaltVim

## Introduction

DaltVim is my own neovim configuration. Obviously, that means it will be catered to my preferences and workflows, but I like to think it could still be useful to other people to peruse.

### Note
Keymap configuration has been quite the mental block, so those are probably the most lacking part of this. There are lots of defaults from kickstart, and I've tweaked a few others, but they definitely need to be restructured to your preferences.
